A bank X is on a massive digital transformation for all its departments. Bank has a growing customer base whee 
majority of them are liability customers (depositors) vs borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding the 
borrowers base rapidly to bring in more business via loan interests. A campaign that the bank ran in last quarter showed an 
average single digit conversion rate. Digital transformation being the core strength of the business strategy, marketing 
department wants to devise effective campaigns with better target marketing to increase the conversion ratio to double digit 
with same budget as per last campaign.
